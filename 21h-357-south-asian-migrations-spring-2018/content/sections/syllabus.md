Course Description
------------------

Millions of South Asians have left their home in the Indian subcontinent since the nineteenth century and settled in America, Europe, Africa, the Caribbean and the Middle East. They are considered a “model minority” in some countries and “unwanted strangers” in others. This course studies how and why this came to be. Through literature, memoirs, films, and historical writing, students will follow Indian migrants as they discovered the world beyond India. This course is a global history of South Asians which introduces students to the cultural, social, economic, and political experiences of immigrants who travelled across the world.
